`manifest.json` records the upstream SHA-256 for every vendored file, with declared
local patch hashes where applicable. Detours and RapidJSON came from pinned GitHub
source archives; ImGui came from pinned upstream source URLs. Builds require no
package manager or network access. Keep each library's license file (`LICENSE` for spdlog, `LICENSE.txt` for the others) in source
distributions and alongside binaries that use it.

Detours owns instruction relocation and hook transactions. The project adapter is
in `Engine/Core/Hooks/hooks.cpp`. RapidJSON supplies the SAX reader and JSON writers;
DingoSDK's owning value model is in `Engine/Core/Json/json.h` and
`Engine/Core/Json/json.cpp`.

The ImGui local vendor patch is `imgui/backends/imgui_impl_dx12.cpp`: font upload
checks resource/command failures, bounds its GPU wait to five seconds, propagates
failure, and retains submitted resources on timeout to avoid premature release.
Detours has a local patch in `detours/src/detours.cpp`: transaction thread and
operation records use `VirtualAlloc`/`VirtualFree` instead of the shared heap.
Enlistment and cleanup can run while another thread owns the heap lock and is
suspended, so ordinary `new`/`delete` can deadlock startup. Both record types use
the same allocation path for successful commits, failed enlistment, and aborts.
The patch also preserves function-entry and jump-back boundaries when the
compact x64 alignment table truncates an offset of eight or more. Thread context
updates distinguish relocated code from the x64 replacement-entry stub and stop
after one remap. The instruction decoder remains upstream. Related upstream
discussions: [allocator deadlock](https://github.com/microsoft/Detours/pull/261)
and [thread context updates](https://github.com/microsoft/Detours/pull/368).

Current patch hashes are recorded under `local_patches`. RapidJSON is unmodified.

spdlog is used header-only with the VS2022 C++20 `std::format` backend;
bundled fmt is not distributed. `Engine/Core/Log` owns shared formatting,
categories, severity filtering, repeat suppression, console output, and a Win32
append sink. The launcher resets the single file before the runtime appends to
it, so two processes never use competing buffered file offsets. This layout
takes inspiration from [R5SDK's logger](https://github.com/R5Reloaded/r5sdk/blob/p4sync/src/core/logger.cpp).

SQLite is the unmodified official C amalgamation, compiled into the runtime. `manifest.json` includes the archive SHA3-256 and individual source
SHA-256 hashes. Extension loading and double-quoted SQL string literals are
disabled; thread safety is enabled. ReSkate uses prepared statements, strict domain
tables, WAL with full synchronous commits, and SQLite's online backup API. The
public-domain notice is retained in `sqlite/LICENSE.txt`.

`steam_networking` contains unmodified public headers for the v012 Steam
Networking Sockets ABI. ReSkate resolves flat exports from the game's verified
original `steam_api64.dll`. It does not link the standalone networking library, and the
client package carries no Steam DLL; the dedicated server package carries the Steam files
it signs in with (see `Server/README.txt`). Keep `steam_networking/LICENSE` with distributions.

LZ4 1.10.0 (`lz4/`) supplies the unmodified BSD-2-Clause block codec for bounded, lossless multiplayer packet compression. Source hashes and upstream tag are recorded in `manifest.json`; packages include `licenses/lz4-LICENSE.txt`.

Lua 5.4.9 (`lua/`) runs the dedicated server's scripts (`Server/server_scripts.cpp`). Its `src/` is
built as C++, without the standalone `lua.c` and `luac.c`. The one local patch, in `lua/src/lstrlib.c`
(marked "ReSkate"), gives pattern matching a work budget (`MAXMATCHSTEPS`): Lua's instruction hooks
cannot stop C code, and a pattern a player types could otherwise stall the server. Both server
packages (`ReSkateServer-<version>.zip` and `ReSkateServer-Linux-<version>.tar.gz`) must ship
`lua/LICENSE.txt` as `licenses/lua-LICENSE.txt`, beside the other libraries' licenses.

Zstandard 1.5.7 (`zstd/`) is the library's common, compress and decompress sources, built without legacy format
support or assembly, for multiplayer packet and game archive compression. It is not
yet hashed in `manifest.json`. Packages include `licenses/zstd-LICENSE.txt` (the
BSD license; `COPYING` is the alternative GPLv2 grant).

miniz supplies the ZIP reader for the launcher's downloads (DepotDownloader, the
content cache, Thunderstore mods) and the dedicated server's updates.
The official 3.1.2 amalgamation is unmodified; compression, archive writing,
zlib compatibility, stdio and timestamp APIs are disabled. Extraction writes only
the expected file to a fixed temporary path, bounds its size, and checks the
uncompressed SHA-256 before replacing the cache. Keep `miniz/LICENSE.txt` with
binary packages. Builds do not fetch the library.
